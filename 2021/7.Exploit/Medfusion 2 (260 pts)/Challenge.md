# Medfusion 2

### Description
Mmm. That infusion pump you accessed at Step 1 delivers very strange medication! Maybe you should look into it before somebody gets sick (well, sicker than initially, we mean)...

Reminder: _medfusion.ph0wn.org_

Note:
- Please leave the pump in the same status as you got it.
- This is a shared equipment. If you think it needs to be reset, please contact us.
- Test your exploits locally, you don't want to harm a patient, do you?
- DO NOT TEST YOUR EXPLOITS BLINDLY ON THE PUMP :) At step 1, you should have found something to help you.
- The Drug Server has a 30 seconds timeout.
