1. Download `portman.zip` and run it locally.
2. Write an exploit on your local version, to reliably invoke /bin/sh.
3. For the final phase, exploit server on http://challenges.ph0wn.org:8080 to get the flag. Please request a slot on the https://ctf.ph0wn.org/hardware_monitoring page, and do not use the server outside your allocated slot.
